module ActiveFedora

  # This class ties together many of the lower-level modules, and
  # implements something akin to an ActiveRecord-alike interface to
  # fedora. If you want to represent a fedora object in the ruby
  # space, this is the class you want to extend.
  #
  # =The Basics
  #   class Oralhistory < ActiveFedora::Base
  #     has_metadata "properties", type: ActiveFedora::SimpleDatastream do |m|
  #       m.field "narrator",  :string
  #       m.field "narrator",  :text
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The above example creates a Fedora object with a metadata datastream named "properties", which is composed of a
  # narrator and bio field.
  #
  # Attached files defined with +contains+ are accessed via the +attached_files+ member hash.
